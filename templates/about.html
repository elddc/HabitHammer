		<p>Habit trackers are only good for one thing: tracking existing habits. Which is cool and all, but what if you want to start a new habit, or stop an old one? Trackers donâ€™t help with that. In fact, they can be downright discouraging.</p>
		<p>Staring at a huge list of tasks leaves you feeling overwhelmed. When you inevitably miss a day, seeing that disappointing hole in your streak makes you want to just give up. To avoid those feelings of guilt and hopelessness, you can play it safe and only track established habits that you already do all the time, but what's the point of tracking those?</p>

		<h1 class="blue">The Solution</h1>
		<p><b>Habit Hammer</b> teaches you how to build and maintain a new habit, or break an old habit.</p>
